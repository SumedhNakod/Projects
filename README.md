# Projects
1. Power BI Projects : Analysing IT Spend for a company from 2001 to 2012.

3. Android Application : Leave application app based on my college procedure.

4. Comment Toxicity Detector : I completed a project using TensorFlow, Keras, and LSTM to develop a comment toxicity classification model. The model accurately categorizes comments into toxicity levels. I performed data preprocessing, including tokenization and sequence padding. The LSTM model was trained on a labeled dataset of comments. I evaluated the model's performance and optimized parameters. I created a Gradio app in Python for real-time toxicity predictions. The project focused on efficiency and user-friendliness. 

4. Uber Data Analysis : I analyzed Uber data using R and ggplot. Preprocessing involved cleaning and formatting the dataset. I explored patterns and correlations, identifying insights on ride frequency, peak hours, and popular routes. Utilizing ggplot, I created visually appealing plots such as line charts and bar graphs to represent findings. The project prioritized efficient analysis and clear visualizations for easy understanding.

5. Hand-written Digit Recognizer : I created a handwritten digit recognizer using Lasagne and Theano libraries. The project involved preprocessing the images, training a neural network model, and evaluating its accuracy. Lasagne and Theano were utilized for efficient computation and high-performance digit recognition.
   
4. Image caption generator : I developed an Image Caption Generator using LSTM and CNN in a project. The model utilized LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for text generation and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for image feature extraction. I preprocessed the images and extracted features using CNN. The LSTM model was trained on these features to generate captions for the images. The project aimed to accurately describe the content of images with textual captions. The LSTM and CNN architectures were implemented efficiently to achieve high-quality image captioning.
